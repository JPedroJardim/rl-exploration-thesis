Tasks

- Build more gridworlds (or use the ones that Joshua gave)
- Construct the mechanism to reach something like Figure 2.b on the FuN article.
- Do a profiling of the code to see if there is any operation that is slowing the code down
- Run different R and C for the different gridworls

Run everything on RAM

Run 1; r = c = 10 (as in the article, used as a baseline):
    - mspacman: aching GPU3
    - spaceinvaders: parkin GPU1
    - montezuma: parkin GPU2

Run 2; r > c ; r = 10 c = 5

Run 3; r < c ; r = 5 c = 10

Run 4: r = c = 5

- 200 epochs for 1M steps for the following environments:
    - MsPacman
    - SpaceInvaders
    - Montezuma



Grid experiments
Run for 2M steps, 20 epochs of 100k steps, each episode for a maximum of 10k steps


Run 1; r = c = 10 (baseline):
Run 2; r > c ; r = 50 c = 10
Run 3; r < c ; r = 10 c = 50
Run 4: r = c = 5
Run 5: r = 1; c = 10 (dLSTM is basically an LSTM)
Run 6: r = c = 50
Run 7: r = c = 1
