Where to write? Word, latex, something else? DONE
- LaTeX is the suggested one.
- There is a template for it.
- OverLeaf is the way to go.

What sort of env can I use to test FuN model?
- Continuous Gridworld with some walls, 5 actions (no_action, north, south, etc.)
- Instead of the Percept use some dense layer

Exploration of FuN
- Store steps done to not lose exploration decay

Start on other agents
- HIRO, possibly

Avoid container shutdown
- reserved /mnt/fast1/pj514
- command "hare reserve ."
